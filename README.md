# introduction 

This study innovates by synthesizing the TF-IDF algorithm with the XGBoost model to develop a first predictive model for trademark rejection appeals. The model demonstrates remarkable performance with an accuracy rate of 68\%, marking a significant academic contribution by filling a research void and proving its practical worth. From the perspective of trademark applicants, the model offers data-driven decision support that mitigates time and financial costs. For administrative and review bodies, it promises to reduce systemic costs associated with handling trademark rejection appeal cases, thereby optimizing efficiency.
